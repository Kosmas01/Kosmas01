👋 Hi, Folk I'm Kosmas

I'm new here, so it,s nice to see you. I'm student at Indormatics and Electronic Systems Engineering department and this will be my personal repository. 
This repository serves as a digital scrapbook, capturing the essence of my academic journey. Inside, you'll find projects, assignments, and perhaps a few eureka moments as I navigate the exciting landscapes of technology.

Let's this adventure begin. 🚀💻
