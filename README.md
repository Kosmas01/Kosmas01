ðŸ‘‹ Hi Folks, I'm Kosmas.

I'm new here, so it,s nice to see you. I'm student at Indormatics and Electronic Systems Engineering department and this will be my personal repository. 
This repository serves as a digital scrapbook, capturing the essence of my academic journey. Inside, you'll find projects, assignments, and perhaps a few eureka moments as I navigate the exciting landscapes of technology.

Let's this adventure begin. ðŸš€ðŸ’»
